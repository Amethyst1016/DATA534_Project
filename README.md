# DATA534_Project


In data1992-2022 file, I try to make gdp data from per three month to one month and enlarge the data from (2016-2022) to (1992 to 2022),the new created data is df.csv

In countinous.rmd, I try to fit the model ,and random forest with samllest mse as 4727

In category.rmd, I try to indicate sp500 to 1 as rising, and 0 as declining, but the model did not fit well in random forest, lad and qda.
